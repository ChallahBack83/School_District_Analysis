# School_District_Analysis

Included is a breakdown of the school district data, comparing Charter and District figures. 

## Summary of Data

Searching through the data, we find that Charter schools have a lower budget on average, but this does not seem to affect their test scores negatively. In fact, Charter schools have an average math score of 68, which is higher than 64, the total average math score for all schools combined. Reading scores are nearly identical between Charter and District schools, but they are still slightly higher.

When you break the math scores down by grade, Charter schools still come out on top in all but the 12th grade. Average math scores are significantly higher both than their District school counterparts and the overall average score. However, scores for District schools all at least maintain the overall average with a dip in the 11th grade. It is important to note, the three largest schools are also Charter schools. 

Additional analysis is needed to further understand the differences between Charter and District schools. I suggest comparing the total number of students by grade and by school type to better understand the difference in the size of data gathered from each type. Comparing scores across individual high schools, along with their budgets and size can paint a picture of the amount of funding per student. Then we can see if there is a correlation between budget and test scores.
